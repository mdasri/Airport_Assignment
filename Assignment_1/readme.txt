AJP Assignment 1 read me

Before you begin to work with this program, do take note of the following:

1. Most important thing to do: IMPORT THE GOOGLE-COLLECTIONS.JAR that can be found
on the root folder of the assignment 1 folder

2. Do note that only search by airport can do the substring search. The search for routes will only work
using search by airport ID

3. Similarly, search by direct/transfer and search by stopovers only allow users to search using airport IDs
